# Simulation

The Webots simulation is a validation environment for controller logic.

- The controller reads inertial data and publishes motor commands.
- The world provided is a minimal placeholder. Replace with a quadcopter PROTO for realistic dynamics.
- Use Webots debug tools and plots to tune controller gains before testing on hardware.
